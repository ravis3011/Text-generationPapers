Corpora Generation for Grammatical Error Correction. *NAACL 2019*. [[PDF]()] \
*We describe two approaches for generating large parallel datasets for GEC using publicly available Wikipedia
data.*

Semantically-Aligned Equation Generation for Solving and Reasoning Math Word Problems. *NAACL 2019*. [[PDF]()] \
*Motivated by the intuition about how human generates the equations given the problem texts, this paper
presents a neural approach to automatically solve math word problems by operating symbols according to their semantic meanings in
texts.*

### NAACL 2018
Interpretable Charge Predictions for Criminal Cases: Learning to Generate Court Views from Fact Descriptions. *NAACL 2018*. [[PDF]()] \
*In this paper, we propose to study the problem of court view generation from the fact description in a criminal case.*

TypeSQL: Knowledge-Based Type-Aware Neural Text-to-SQL Generation. *NAACL 2018*. [[PDF]()] \
*In this paper, we present a novel approach TypeSQL which formats the problem as a slot filling task in a more reasonable way.*

Learning to Generate Wikipedia Summaries for Underserved Languages from Wikidata. *NAACL 2018*. *NAACL 2018*. [[PDF]()] \
*In this work, we investigate the generation of open domain Wikipedia summaries in underserved languages using structured data from Wikidata.*

## Dataset
### ACL 2019 
Storyboarding of Recipes: Grounded Contextual Generation. *ACL 2019*. [[PDF]()] \
*We introduce a dataset for sequential procedural (how-to) text generation from images in cooking domain.*

Curate and Generate: A Corpus and Method for Joint Control of Semantics and Style in Neural NLG. *ACL 2019*. [[PDF]()] \
*We present YelpNLG, a corpus of 300,000 rich, parallel meaning representations and highly stylistically varied reference texts spanning different restaurant attributes, and describe a novel methodology that can be scalably reused to generate NLG datasets for other domains.*

Towards Empathetic Open-domain Conversation Models: A New Benchmark and Dataset. *ACL 2019*. [[PDF]()] \
*This work proposes a new benchmark for empathetic dialogue generation and EmpatheticDialogues, a novel dataset of 25k conversations grounded in emotional situations.*

Explain Yourself! Leveraging Language Models for Commonsense Reasoning. *ACL 2019*. [[PDF]()] \
*We collect human explanations for commonsense reasoning in the form of natural language sequences and highlighted annotations in a new dataset called Common Sense Explanations (CoS-E). We use CoS-E to train language models to automatically generate explanations that can be used during training and inference in a novel Commonsense Auto-Generated Explanation (CAGE) framework.*

Know More about Each Other: Evolving Dialogue Strategy via Compound Assessment. *ACL 2019*. [[PDF]()] \
*In this paper, a novel Generation-Evaluation framework is developed for multi-turn conversations with the objective of letting both participants know more about each other.*

Handling Divergent Reference Texts when Evaluating Table-to-Text Generation. *ACL 2019*. [[PDF]()] \
*We propose a new metric, PARENT, which aligns n-grams from the reference and generated texts to the semi-structured data before computing their precision and recall.*

### NAACL 2019 
Evaluating Rewards for Question Generation Models. *NAACL 2019*. [[PDF]()] \
*We therefore optimise directly for various objectives beyond simply replicating the ground truth questions,
including a novel approach using an adversarial discriminator that seeks to generate questions that are indistinguishable from real
examples.*

Unifying Human and Statistical Evaluation for Natural Language Generation. *NAACL 2019*. [[PDF]()] \
*In this paper, we propose a unified framework which evaluates both diversity and quality, based on the optimal
error rate of predicting whether a sentence is human- or machine-generated.*
